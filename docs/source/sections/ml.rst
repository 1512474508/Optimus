Machine Learning with Optimus
==================================

Machine Learning is one of the last steps, and the goal for most Data Science Workflows.

Apache Spark created a library called MLlib where they coded great algorithms for Machine Learning. Now
with the ML library we can take advantage of the Dataframe API and its optimization to create easily
Machine Learning Pipelines.

Even though this task is not extremely hard, is not easy. The way most Machine Learning models work on Spark
are not straightforward, and they need lots feature engineering to work. That's why we created the :ref:`feature-
engineering`.

Now with Optimus you can use this really easy feature engineering with our Machine Learning Library.

Let's take a look of what Optimus can do for you:
